### What I learned

This take on a project was a lot different than all the other ways I've been learning development writing. It was still a simple project but being told what to do and what was expected in the end was a nice way to learn rather than the follow along method I've been getting used to doing.

### Continued development

Flexbox is something I need to keep using more and stay more familiar with so I don't have to keep looking up the cheat sheets.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.css-tricks.com) - I used this to freshen up on my flexbox usage.
